# Genre_is_music
## What is it that this project does?
This project allows you to upload any audio sample(it can be a song but for better results, it should be a song) and you will be able to see its "genre".
## How does it work?
I have used python packages such as __tensorflow, keras, librosa, werkzeug__ and many more of their kind to develop a __deep learning__ model that can classify any song into 10 genres
1. Blues
2. Classical
3. Country
4. Disco
5. Hip-Hop
6. Jazz
7. Metal
8. Pop
9. Reggae
10. Rock

There isn't a database that I have used in this project, it's a buffer. As soon as the user reaches the end of the transaction, the audio file from the buffer gets deleted to save memory.
## How to use it?
I have developed the whole project in my local environment, and if you want to use it right now, you will have to : 
1. Clone the repository into your local environment
2. Run main.py in any production IDE for python.
3. You will see a link __http://127.0.0.1:5000/__
4. Click on it and you are good to go.

Footnote : I will be deploying it very soon on a PAAS(__P__ latform __A__ s __A__ __S__ ervice) or an IAAS(__I__ nterface __A__ s __A__ __S__ ervice) and will surely mention the working link in this readme file. Although I have tried to deploy this model on Microsoft Azure, but I am always getting some errors but I am hopeful to resolve them.
